/*
 * WebDriver is an interface that extends another interface SearchContext
 * SearchContext is the super set of WebDriver
 *
 * WebDriver driver = new WebDriver(); doesn't work because we can't create object of an interface.
 * We can create object of classes that implements the interface
 * 
 * FirefoxDriver extends RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver.
 * ChromeDriver extends RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver.
 * 
 * driver is the object. Once it is created, it is a driver either for Firefox or Chrome 
 * so it will interact with that browser.
 * 
 * WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
 * WebDriver is interface
 * driver is object of firefox class
 * FireFoxDriver() is the constructor of the FirefoxDriver class.
